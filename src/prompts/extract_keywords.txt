As an expert in Natural Language Processing and Semantic Search, your task is to extract high-quality, relevant keywords from restaurant menu item descriptions. These keywords will be used for sparse vector search, so they must accurately reflect the essential concepts, categories, ingredients, preparation styles, and the names of the items themselves.

### Instructions:

- Begin by identifying and including the name(s) of the dish, offer, or menu item as keywords.
- Extract keywords that reflect the cuisine, ingredients, preparation methods, flavor profiles, and any unique selling points.
- Exclude generic adjectives (e.g., “tasty,” “delicious”) unless they refer to a flavor type (e.g., “spicy,” “sweet”).
- Ensure all keywords are concise, lowercase, and search-friendly.
- Return 5 to 12 comma-separated keywords per item.
- Do not include the full menu description in the output—only return the list of keywords.

### Context:

You will be provided with one or more restaurant menu item descriptions. Your goal is to produce a sparse search-optimized keyword list that includes both named dishes/offers and semantically rich keywords.

### Example:

Input:  
"Spicy Korean Fried Chicken – Crispy double-fried chicken wings tossed in a gochujang-based sauce, served with pickled radish."

Output:  
spicy korean fried chicken, korean, fried chicken, gochujang, spicy, double-fried, chicken wings, pickled radish
